                            <p>Peace with ourselves. With food. With life.</p>
                            <p>Here are a few things you already know:</p>
                            
                            <p>Peace does not, will not, come by way of the latest detox plan on the magazine cover. Or by fitting back into your favorite college jeans. Or by continuing on a path of hungers denied.</p>
                            
                            <p>Deep down you know you are are worth more than any number or size.</p>
                            
                            <p>You also know that you are deserving of the same kindness, trust, and compassion you show to those you care about.</p>

                            <p>You know that peace cannot be faked. You don’t want to try to fake it anymore. You are starving for the real-deal ease-in-your-own-skin exhale-inducing comes-from-the-inside peace.</p>

                            <p>But somewhere along the way, you started to believe that it wasn’t safe to trust yourself. To trust your hungers. To feed yourself what you’ve been hungering for your whole life.</p>

                            <p>I know the struggle well because it was once mine. I have been there.</p>

                            <p>I know that a hungry woman, which I was for many years, is consumed by what she is hungry for. I also know that a Well-fed Woman consumes what she’s hungry for and is free because of that.</p>
                            
                            <p>I believe you were meant for more than you’ve been told and sold.</p>

                            <p>Today, my life’s work is to teach, model, and encourage women to trust their hungers and to not stop until they’re full.</p>

                            <p>We're going on a 12-week guided journey from February to April 2015. Thirty women will gather together with me from all corners of the world to connect, to share, to encourage, to uplift, to nurture, to heal, and to grow.  We will meet online and you will work in your own time and space.</p>
                            <p>It's a radical act for a woman to choose a life of feast, rather than a life of famine.</p>

                    <p>You are whip smart brilliant. Your bookshelf is overflowing with “self-help” books you’ve read (and several you haven’t) - all of which you thought would change your life.</p>
                    
                    <p>You believe in a sacred life force. You swim in the deep end.</p>

                    <p>You know everything is connected and the whole is much greater than its parts.</p>

                    <p>You could practically be a nutritionist yourself, with all of the knowledge you’ve absorbed through the years.</p>

                    <p>Intellectually, you ‘get’ why diets don’t work.</p>

                    <p>The thing is, all this knowing hasn’t made you feel at ease around food, at home in your body, or open-hearted with yourself. And this recognition is hard to acknowledge.</p>

                    <p>Food feels hard. Self-compassion feels hard. Riding (yet again) the pendulum of restriction to overconsumption and back again feels even worse.</p>

                    <p>You are on the cusp of a cease fire with yourself.</p>

                    <p>And so...</p>

                    <p>I see you. You are ready. Unwilling to wait another year. Chasing weight loss, exhausted by your inner critic, hungry and distracted by your cravings. You have promised yourself that this will not be your story going forward.</p>

                    <p>It’s time to lay it all down.</p>

                    <p>It’s time to step off the tightrope and choose the easeful path.</p>

                            <p>I created <em>Feast</em> because it’s possible to live a life that feels kind, nourishing, and easeful.</p>
                            <p>I created <em>Feast</em> to teach women how to feed themselves – at the table, and away from it.</p>

                                <p>But perhaps most importantly, your investment in <em>Feast</em> is an external commitment to the inner transformation you are stepping into. Into this program, I am putting the very best teaching, trainings, experiential and empathic insights I have around helping women break free once and for all.

                    <div class="ta-left">
                        <p><span>FIRST,</span> <em>Feast</em> is NOT a diet program nor is it intended to help women lose weight. Therefore, if you are hoping to or counting on losing weight with this program, this is not the program for you. <em>Feast</em> is about coming home to ourselves, our bodies, and our hungers. <em>Feast</em> celebrates the broad diversity of body sizes in the world and acknowledges that health exists across the body size-spectrum. The long-term outcome of the provided practices is often a return to one’s set-point weight. For some this will be higher than their current weight and for others it will be lower and for some it will result in no change at all. Regardless, weight change is not a goal of <em>Feast</em>, rather this course is for women who have begun to understand that their happiness and wellbeing is not dependent on a number on the scale.</p>

                        <p><span>SECOND,</span> <em>Feast</em> is designed for women who are prepared to make space in their lives to fully participate in the program. It will be an intensive three months, designed with the feel of spaciousness and plenty of integration time. The thirty spaces in this program are meant for women who are ready now... those who are willing, and able to create time in their schedule to dedicate to doing the work and connecting with others on the same path.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>It's a radical act for a woman to choose a life of feast, rather than a life of famine.</p>

This is an opportunity to learn how to fish. <em>Feast</em> is an investment in your freedom. <em>Feast</em> is also a financial investment and the price reflects the profound shifts participants can expect to achieve.

                                  Online learning isn’t necessarily harder than in-person learning, but it is different. A huge benefit of the virtual nature of <em>Feast</em> is that you and I don’t have to live in the same town in order for us to intimately connect and for you to learn. You can also participate in the course from your home, office, or favorite coffee shop. And for the most part, you can also engage in learning during the time of day that works best for you.

                                  New experiences often present a feeling of exhilaration, of wonderment, of uncertainty. Your feelings are important and good to notice. Feeling scared or nervous might be an indication that this is something you really want, and maybe have not thought you’d be able to have. Get still, listen closely to your intuition, trust your gut. Just like women know when they’re Well-fed, you will know if <em>Feast</em> is the next step in your journey. If, after getting still, you still have questions about whether <em>Feast</em> is a good for you, <a href="http://rachelwcole.com/connect/" style="color:#EF7061 !important"><em>please reach out</em></a> and let me know.
